Resting fMRI Preprocessing Pipeline based on MELODIC-FSL
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

###1.  Prepare the data (i.e., arrange in a folder) for the Pre-processing (create the .nii and reorient)
# Create folder for each group (i.e., control, patients), for each group, create folders for each subject. Inside the each subject folder keep T1 and Rest-fMRI datas (.img or .nii format) in the separate folder. Like below structure
                   
 
# Create T1 file to a nifti_gz file with the T1 and reorient for each subjects using below command: 

fslchfiletype NIFTI_GZ *hdr T1_a
fslreorient2std T1_a.nii.gz T1_a_r.nii.gz

# Create FMRI 4D nifti_gz file and reorient for each subjects using below command: 
  
cd ../rest
fslmerge -t rest.nii.gz *.img
fslmerge -tr restTR2.nii.gz rest.nii.gz 2
fslreorient2std restTR2.nii.gz restTR2_r.nii.gz

# Do BET extraction for T1 

bet T1_a_r.nii.gz T1_a_r_brain.nii.gz -R -f 0.15 -g 0 -m

# Improve Brain extracted mask by fsleye 
# To improving the BET, open fsleyes and then opent the mask then clean it. Then, save the mask with the same name
cd ../mprage
fsleyes T1_a_r T1_a_r_brain_mask

#OR use SPM segmentation to generate brain extracted mask (this approach is automated and easyer)


# Then multiply the mask with reoriented T1 images to get proper brain extracted image 

fslmaths T1_a_r_brain_mask -mul T1_a_r_brain T1_a_r_brain2
#-or-
fslmaths T1_a_r_spm_brain_mask -mul T1_a_r.nii.gz T1_a_r_brain2




###2. RUN the MELODIC: open fsl gui, then go to MELODIC 

You can select all the subjects at a time. Be care full the fMRI data and T1 data must be in the same sequence. 

Mics: No change
DATA= select all the data (using “select 4D data option”) of all the subjects in one Group, The TR will detect automatically as per your data, the filter 100 (default)
Pre-State=yes, Slice Timing correction = interleaved, Motion Correction = MCFLIRT, Intencity Norm = Yes, rest is default
Registration=”click on main structural image” and sellect structural image for all subjects (using “select main structural images option”). Select Linear=6 DOF. Rest is defaukt
Stats= Keep all default
Post-Stats= Keep all default
Hit RUN

#OUTPUT: melodic.ica and it will appear a window with all the details of the preprocessing. In pre-stats check the movement and check the registration done well or not  



###3. In order to remove the noise we use Fsleyes, Check the ICAs to mark noise ics and regress out the noise components
# To check the ICAs to mark noise and signal manually use below comand, it will open with fsleyes. mark the ICs 
# and save the lavbels in the same folder wirth name "hand_labels_noise.txt" 

fsleyes --scene melodic -ad restTR2_r.ica/filtered_func_data.ica

# To Regress out the noise components

#get the IC numbers
tail -1 restTR2_r.ica/hand_labels_noise.txt

#run fsl_regfilt
fsl_regfilt -i restTR2_r.ica/filtered_func_data.nii.gz \
            -d restTR2_r.ica/filtered_func_data.ica/melodic_mix \
            -o restTR2_r.ica/filtered_func_data_clean.nii.gz \
            -f "1, 2, 3, ...." 



#OUTPUT: it will creat cleaned 4D data named "filtered_func_data_clean.nii.gz"


### 5. func_data_clean.nii.gz.nii is your cleaned data on which you can extract the BOLD time series and could do the post processing.
